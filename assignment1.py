# 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
# integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.


# *         -> Multiplication Operator
# 'hello'   -> String
# -87.8     -> Floating point number
# -         -> Subraction Operator
# /         -> Division Operator
# +         -> Addition Operator 
# 6         -> Integer Number 


# 2. What is the difference between string and variable?

# String : it is a collection of characters i.e alphabets, numbers, special characters etc 
# Variable : it is a container in the memory  to which we can assign a value and perform action 



# 3. Describe three different data types.

# INT Data Type  : interger number ( with out decimal points )
# Floating Point number : number with decimal points 
# String : Collection of characters 
# Bool :  Boolean Data type, Possible values : True / False 


# 4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do? 

# Expressions are made up of both operators and operands used to perform an action / calculation from which we can obtain a value 


# 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an

# # expression and a statement?

# Expression contains only opeartors , Variables ( Operands) and an expression results a value 
# example : 2+3
# Statement is everthing that makes up  the code in the python code with; expression is also the part of Statement
#  example : print(2+3)


# 6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?


# bacon = 22
# bacon + 1

# The bacon value will be 22 

# 7. What should the values of the following two terms be?


# 'spam'+'spamspam' =>  'spamspamspam'
#  'spam'*3 => 'spamspamspam'



# 8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

# Because the variable name cannot start with a number 



# 9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
# version of a value?

#  To get int version of a value we use  =====>  int(VALUE)
#  To get float version of a value we use  =====>  float(VALUE)
#  To get string version of a value we use =======> str(VALUE)


# 10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?

#  'I have eaten' + 99 + ' burritos'

# => because we cannot append integer with a string value 
#  in the above example 'I have eaten ' and 'burritos ' is a string and 99 number hence we got the error
